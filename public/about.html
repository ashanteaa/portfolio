<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Shanti Mhatre — a B.Tech graduate in Data Science passionate about combining technology, analytics, and design to create impactful solutions. My projects range from developing a pregnancy and postpartum tracking app in React Native to building a personal fitness tracker with machine learning models like SVM, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression. </p>

<p>I’ve also gained practical experience in DevOps and cybersecurity during my internship at BARC, where I set up secure centralized logging systems using the ELK stack and Wazuh. Beyond the technical side, I’ve led teams of 50+ as a Student Council Graphics Head and Social Media Team Lead, where I boosted engagement through creative content and strategic planning.</p

<p>Currently, I’m exploring UI/UX design to bring more human-centered thinking into my data and development work. I love collaborating with teams, solving problems through data-driven approaches, and building tools that make everyday life easier.</p>
<p>When I’m not coding or designing, you’ll find me scrolling reddit, watching movies or series, or experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen. I’m always eager to connect with like-minded professionals and explore new opportunities in tech and design.</p>
<p>Feel free to reach out if you want to chat about tech, design, or potential collaborations!</p>
<p>Best, <br/> Shanti Mhatre</p>
